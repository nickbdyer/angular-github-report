#Angular Github Reporter

Week 6 at Makers Academy

###The Brief

This was intended to be a repeat of the previous exercise, creating a small app
to scrape the Github Repo and determine their progress through the Makers
Academy Course. 

The obvious difference being that AngularJS should be used over JQuery.

###New Technologies

- AngularJs
- Bower
- Karma Test Runner

###Improvements

The UX is not very good for this app, I would like to alter it and make it more
functional and user friendly.
